## Data Quality Analysis

Senior Manager for my current project at Deloitte was interested in automating data quality analysis tasks. This script was created as an example to show how this could be done.

The script is a user-defined function that requires certain inputs to locate the pattern provided by the user. The user has the option to replace the pattern with a new string, delete rows containing the pattern, or filter rows containing the pattern. The user can search for the pattern in multiple columns.
