## KangaTech Measurements

KangaTech equipment measures "neuromuscular strength, endurance, and control". These measurements have the potential to determine the degree of injury risk. 

While working for the LA Angels, I was asked by the Director of Performance Integration to create summary reports indicating any red flags in a player's KangaTech measurements. I was able to automate the generation of these Excel reports for all players in the organization (seven levels). 

The R script for generating the reports and example output for players at the MLB level are shown.
