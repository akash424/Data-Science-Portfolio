# Data-Science-Portfolio

I am continually seeking to learn new technologies and programs, in addition to enhancing my skills in data science, machine learning, statistics, and optimization. I am interested in applying quantitative methods to business strategy, finance, healthcare operations, and basketball analytics. 

The data science projects contained within this repository are separated by the programming language that was used.
The main projects which highlight my experience in data science are described below.

### R Projects/R Shiny Visualizations/NHTS
Learned R Shiny independently while interning for the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG). 
Analyzed National Household Travel Survey datasets, which contain 1,000,000+ rows each, to understand how trip rates vary based on geographic region and demographic factors.
Created an R Shiny app to visualize the findings using stacked bar charts and chloropeth maps.

### Python Projects/Predicting Cannabis Use
Conducted a research project for graduate level course to predict adolescents' risk of cannabis use based on their parents' genetics, their own genetics, and other family-related information.
Cleaned and pre-processed the data, and trained multinomial regression and random forest models.
Developed a strong familiarity with common Python libraries (sci-kit learn, numpy, pandas) through this project. 

### R Projects/KangaTech Measurements
Created an R script that generated automated reports in Excel summarizing KangaTech measurements (neuromuscular conditioning) of all players in the LA Angels organization and highlighting any red flags for the performance and training staff.
